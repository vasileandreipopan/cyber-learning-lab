# Cryptography Glossary ‚Äî Basic Terms Explained

## üîê Core Terms

### Algorithm
A step-by-step mathematical procedure used to secure or transform data.  
Examples: AES, RSA, SHA-256.

### Cipher
Another word for ‚Äúencryption method.‚Äù  
A cipher transforms readable text (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext).

### Key
A secret value used by an algorithm to encrypt or decrypt data.  
Without the right key, decryption should be practically impossible.

### Symmetric Encryption
Same key used for both encryption and decryption.  
Fast, used for large data. Example: **AES**.

### Asymmetric Encryption
Two keys: one public, one private.  
Used for secure communication and digital signatures. Example: **RSA**, **ECC**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Algorithms

### RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman)
- A **public-key** system based on prime numbers and modular exponentiation.
- Security comes from how hard it is to factor large numbers.
- Used for encryption, signatures, and key exchange.

### ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- Like RSA, but built on points of a mathematical curve instead of primes.
- Offers same security with smaller keys (faster, more efficient).

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- A **symmetric cipher** used worldwide (e.g., HTTPS, disk encryption).
- Works on fixed-size blocks (128 bits) with keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

### Hash Function
Transforms any input into a fixed-size ‚Äúdigest.‚Äù  
Used to verify integrity and store passwords. Example: **SHA-256**.

### Digital Signature
Proof that data came from a specific sender and wasn‚Äôt modified.  
Created with a private key, verified with a public key.

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
System that manages digital certificates and trusted authorities (used in HTTPS).
