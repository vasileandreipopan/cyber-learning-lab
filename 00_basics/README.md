# 00_basics ‚Äî Cryptography Foundations

This section builds the mathematical and logical background needed to understand and implement cryptography.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand **how data is represented** (binary, hex, base64).
- Learn **modular arithmetic** and its role in cryptographic algorithms.
- Master **XOR logic**, a key concept for encryption and hashing.
- Grasp **prime numbers, divisibility, and modular inverses**, which are the backbone of public-key systems.
- Build the intuition that will make algorithms like **RSA** and **AES** feel natural later.
