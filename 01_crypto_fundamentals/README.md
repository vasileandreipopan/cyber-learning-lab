# 01_crypto_fundamentals

This section builds on the mathematical foundation learned in `00_basics` and applies it to real cryptographic systems.

Each topic explores **how math becomes security** — from the theory behind encryption to the vulnerabilities found in real-world implementations.

## Folder Structure

- **notes/** → Detailed theory and explanations of cryptographic systems  
- **exercises/** → Conceptual challenges to reinforce understanding  
- **mini_projects/** → Small case studies combining multiple concepts  

## Learning Path

1. RSA — Foundations of public-key cryptography  
2. AES — Symmetric encryption and block cipher design  
3. Hashing — Data integrity and one-way functions  
4. Diffie–Hellman — Secure key exchange  
5. ECC — Modern lightweight asymmetric crypto  
6. Digital Signatures — Authentication and identity  
7. Attacks — How crypto fails in practice
